H2 console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console/ connect as Generic H2 (Embedded), org.h2.Driver, jdbc:h2:mem:orders, sa/password

# Remarks

Lombok has regrettably not been used because not "production ready" - to be verified.

Validation has been skipped for brevity

Security also skipped for ease of demoing

In the DB the validation of enumerated columns is missing - it should be implemented by triggers of by CHECK constraint

Builder pattern not use for brevity
